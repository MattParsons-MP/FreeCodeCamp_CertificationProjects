      <p>First-person view (FPV), also known as remote-person view (RPV), or video piloting, is a method used to control a radio-controlled vehicle from the driver or pilot's viewpoint.</p>
      <p> Most commonly it is used to pilot a radio-controlled aircraft or other type of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) such as a military drone.<p/>

      <p>This guide assumes you have experience and understanding of how remote vehicles work. If utilising the technology with aircraft, a firm understanding of aircraft flight principles, physics and aircraft systems are crucial.</p>

      <p>A camera. Firstly an FPV system requires a camera (vehicle mounted).</p>
      <p>A transmitter is connected to the camera to 'transmit' the image (vehicle mounted).</p>
      <p>A receiver is required to 'receive' the image from the vehicle mounted transmitter (ground station mounted).</p>
      <p> A display is connected to the receiver unit. This displays the received image</p>

      <p>FPV systems generally come in two flavours:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Analogue</li>
        <li>Digital</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Analogue systems are generally cheaper than digital.</p>
      <p>Analogue systems generally have a lower latency than digital systems.</p>
      <p>Analogue systems generally have a lower image quality compared to digital.</p>

    <section class="main-section"  id="latency">
      <header>Latency</header>
      <p>Latency is the time lost between transmitting and receiving data. If you are familiar with the term lag, this may be easier to understand. This is normally measured in (ms) and lower latency is desired in FPV systems. If a system had a latency of 10 secs, the image you receive is effectively 10 secs old. This means you could have hit an obstacle and you would not know until 10 secs had passed. </p>
